slither_c64
===========
Slither is a small and simple game for the C64 that is the result of some of my
experimentation with retrocomputing and 6502/6510 assembler programming (my
first attempt at it since the 80s).

To build and run on Mac OS, get [Dustlayer](http://www.dustlayer.com) and run
`dust compile`.
